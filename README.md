🌸 Iris Species Prediction App

This is an interactive machine learning web application built with Streamlit and Python that predicts the species of the famous Iris flower dataset based on user-input flower measurements.

Users can adjust the sliders for Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width to predict the species:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

🚀 Features

Interactive UI built with Streamlit

Real-time prediction of Iris species

Sliders for feature input (Sepal/Petal measurements)

Clean and simple design
